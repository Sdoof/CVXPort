1. data server - IB
2. Better heartbeat handling - register / exit / lost connection - or change the whole mechanism as "connection"
3. improve controller http
4. error handling with asyncio?
5. run baseline strategy live
6. better performance recording / analysis
7. if need to write pullin code multiple times. why not build a new socket class to wrap it up?

2. asyncio.run will create a new loop in each run. Coroutine defined outside will fall in another loop and not be run
